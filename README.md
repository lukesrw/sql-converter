# SQL Converter

## [Online Converter](https://sql.lukesrw.co.uk)

### Usage

Using the converter you can quickly swap between writing application JS/PHP code and database SQL queries.

Want to try your query with different values? Slow debugging in-application? Paste the code and use SQL directly.

Once you're happy that the updated SQL works, copy the JS/PHP back into your application and get back to work!

### Setup

If you want a copy to make changes or use the tool locally, you can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lukesrw/sql-converter.git
```

Then run the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

You can make your own modifications to the tool by updating [`/src/app/page.tsx`](/src/app/page.tsx).

If you build a fantastic feature [make sure to pull request it](https://github.com/lukesrw/sql-converter/compare), so others can see your contributions.
